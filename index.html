<h3>Grading</h3>
 As your syllabus states, homework is <b>30%</b> of your final grade. Homework assignments are assigned weekly and will be graded and posted on Canvas 2-3 days after submission. I will then post the answers to the homework assignments on Canvas.<br>

<b>Note:</b> I will allow 3 late homework assignments. There will be a 10% deduction of the homework grade for every day late up to 3 days. This means that the highest grade you can get on an assignment submitted 1 day late is 90%, 2 days late, 80%, and 3 days late 70%. Homework submitted any later will receive a 0, as I will be posting the solutions. After 3 late homework assignments, all other late work will recieve a 0.
