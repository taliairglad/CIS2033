 ### Grading
 As your syllabus states, homework is **30%** of your final grade. Homework assignments are assigned weekly and will be graded and posted on Canvas 3-4 days after submission. I will then post the answers to the homework assignments on Canvas.

Note: I will allow 3 late homework assignments. There will be a 10% deduction of the homework grade for every day late up to 3 days. This means that the highest grade you can get on an assignment submitted 1 day late is 90%, 2 days late, 80%, and 3 days late 70%. Homework submitted any later will receive a 0, as I will be posting the solutions. After 3 late homework assignments, all other late work will recieve a 0. If you have a compelling reason that your work it late, let me know!
